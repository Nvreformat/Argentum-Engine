# Compiling

To compile, run make.sh. It will output an executable called Game which is a demo of the engine working.

Unfortunately, I can't get it to work on Windows (using GCC, I have not tried vith Visual Studio)
Theorically, the code should be compatible with Windows

# Dependencies

*SFML (2.3.2)
